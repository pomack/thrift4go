# N.B.(matttproud): This step may fail to run with sudo due to sudo clearing
#                   environment variables before changing permissions for
#                   security reasons.  This can be avoided by using the
#                   DESTDIR construct described above to provide emissions to
#                   an intermediate directory for subsequent manual merging.
